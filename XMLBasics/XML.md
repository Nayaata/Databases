#XML

##XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
* Universal language (notation) for describing structured data using text with tags
  * The data is stored together with the meta-data about it
  * Used to describe other languages (formats) for data representation
* XML looks like HTML
  * Text based language, uses tags and attributes
  
###Why Study XML?
XML plays an important role in many IT systems.

For this reason, it is important for all software developers to have a good understanding of XML.

Before you continue, you should also have a basic understanding of:

 * HTML
 * JavaScript

If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our Home page.

###What is XML?
 * XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language
 * XML is a markup language much like HTML
 * XML was designed to store and transport data
 * XML was designed to be self-descriptive
 * XML is a W3C Recommendation

###XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
 * The XML language has no predefined tags.
 * The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
 * HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
 * With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

###XML is Extensible
 * Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).
 * Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <data>).
 * Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.
